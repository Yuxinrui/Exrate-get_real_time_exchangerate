# get-real-time-exchange-rates(Exr
I found that it is not convenient to obtain real-time exchange rate in practical application. In today's economic globalization, exchange rate is becoming more and more important, which is required by many software. Therefore, we can use a function to obtain the required data by making the Execute library, which makes it convenient to obtain the exchange rate. The current version is 0.0.1. There are many areas that have not been improved, and will continue to be updated in the future.
I am not really profassional about programming. So please forgive mistakes in it. If you have any good ideas, you are welcomed to leave comments or send e-mail to me. 
The file "__init__.py" is the source code of the third party library "Exrate 0.0.1".
